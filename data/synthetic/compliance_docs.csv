- Physical threats: within 24 hours to the Electricity Sector Information Sharing and Analysis Center
- Voltage collapse events exceeding 300MW: within 1 hour to the Regional Entity
- Load shedding events exceeding 100MW: within 24 hours using DOE Form OE-417

- Fuel supply emergencies affecting reliability
- Load shedding of 100 MW or more
- Voltage reductions of 3 percent or more
- Public appeals to reduce electricity use
- Physical attacks on facilities
- Cyber events affecting reliability
- Major transmission line outages

1.1 Modeling data for generators, transmission lines, and loads
1.2 System topology representing realistic operating conditions  
1.3 Transfer limits between areas
1.4 Reactive power capabilities
For cascade failure risk assessment, models must simulate N-1-1 contingencies and identify potential cascade initiating nodes (weak points in the system topology).

- Voltage regulation requirements
- Protection system requirements
- Metering requirements  
- Communication requirements
For substations identified as critical cascade points, additional redundancy requirements apply:
- Dual protection systems
- Backup power supply with minimum 8-hour capacity
- Real-time monitoring and automatic alerts

- All generators must maintain reactive power output within capability curves
- Transmission Operators shall implement voltage reduction procedures per ERCOT protocols
- Load shedding may be ordered if voltage drops below 0.92 per unit
For winter storm conditions, additional protocols apply:
- Natural gas generators must maintain fuel supply coordination
- Wind generation forecasting accuracy requirements increase
- Emergency demand response programs may be activated",2021-06-01,"ERCOT, voltage, winter storm, load shedding, demand response",PROCEDURE

1. Assess extent of outage and identify black start resources
2. Establish cranking paths from black start units
3. Restore transmission backbone in priority order
4. Coordinate load pickup with Transmission Operators
5. Monitor frequency and voltage during restoration
Critical path substations (identified through cascade analysis) receive priority for restoration.

WINTER_STORM_URI_REPORT,FERC-NERC-2021,February 2021 Cold Weather Outages - Final Report,Executive Summary,"The February 2021 winter storm (Uri) caused widespread outages across Texas and the central United States. Key findings:
- 4.5 million customers lost power at peak
- Generation outages totaled 52,277 MW
- Natural gas supply interruptions cascaded to generators
- Winterization failures were primary cause
- Cascade failures initiated at substations with single points of failure
Recommendations include: enhanced weatherization requirements, improved fuel supply coordination, identification of cascade-vulnerable nodes through graph-based analysis, and mandatory extreme weather planning scenarios.",2021-11-01,"winter storm Uri, cascade, weatherization, natural gas, Texas",GUIDANCE
